"""Apply an already-fitted transform to (1) a new image and (2) a set of points.

The subtlety: images and points move in OPPOSITE directions for the same
transform.

  * An ITK/ANTs transform maps output(fixed) -> input(moving) *coordinates*.
  * Resampling an IMAGE with the FORWARD transforms therefore carries image
    content moving -> fixed:      -t Warp -t GenericAffine
  * Applying those same transforms to a POINT sends it fixed -> moving (the
    opposite way). So to carry POINTS moving -> fixed you use the INVERSE
    transforms:                   -t [GenericAffine,1] -t InverseWarp

So: same conceptual direction (moving -> fixed), but images use the forward list
and points use the inverse list.

Runs without ANTs (prints the commands); if the inputs and ANTs are present it
actually executes. Point I/O uses commandants.io.
