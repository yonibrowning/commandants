"""Translate a process exit code into a human explanation.

Reality check: ANTs (like most ITK/C++ tools) does **not** publish a table of
numbered error codes. Its binaries exit ``0`` on success and ``1`` on failure
(the real detail is in stderr). Everything else you see is one of:

* a **POSIX signal** -- Python's ``subprocess`` reports these as a *negative*
  return code (``-9`` = killed by signal 9 = SIGKILL); shells report them as
  ``128 + N`` (``137`` = 128 + 9 = SIGKILL);
* a **Windows exception code** (NTSTATUS), e.g. ``3221225477`` = access violation.

The single most common one for registration -- ``-9`` / ``137`` (SIGKILL) -- is
almost always the out-of-memory killer or a cluster memory limit. Estimate first
with :meth:`AntsRegistration.estimate_resources`.
