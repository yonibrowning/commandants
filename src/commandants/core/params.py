"""Formatting helpers for ANTs command-line arguments.

ANTs uses two recurring argument idioms that these helpers centralize so their
quirks live in exactly one place:

* **Bracketed parameter lists** -- e.g. ``MI[fixed.nii,moving.nii,1,32]`` or
  ``[corrected.nii,bias.nii]``. Trailing unset values are dropped so the emitted
  string matches how ANTs itself is normally invoked.
* **``x``-joined multi-resolution vectors** -- e.g. ``1000x500x250x0`` for
  iterations, shrink factors, and smoothing sigmas.
